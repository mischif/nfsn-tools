##	     NearlyFreeSpeech.Net WordPress Update Script README               ##

1) What does this script do?
This script updates the core files of an SVN install of WordPress.

2) What if I installed WordPress via ZIP file?
This script will not work for you. However, should you later want to reinstall
WordPress using SVN to take advantage of this script, take a look at wpinstall.

3) Does this script update plugins as well?
No, only the core Wordpress files. However, jjeaton has released his own script
that updates plugins, I don't see any reason you couldn't use both.

4) Is there any setup with this script?
Yes. First you must move the publicupdate folder to somewhere in /home/public.
You may rename it if you wish; I place it directly in /home/public and call
it wpupdate.

After you have placed the folder you must open the file htaccess inside the
folder and change both the address in AuthDigestDomain to point to the folder's
location on the web and the address in AuthUserFile to point to the folder's
location on disk. Use the Apache Site Root in your site's information to find
the location of the folder on disk. Leave the .htdigest ending there.

After modifying the file, change the name of the file to ".htaccess" and get a
long, random string of characters to use as a password - the longer the better,
after setting the script up you'll never have to touch it again. Once you have
obtained the password, navigate inside the folder in a terminal and run the
command "htdigest -c .htdigest "Private Interface" wpupdate" without the outer
quotes. Enter the password twice to complete this section.

Finally, open wpupdate.sh in a text editor and change the values of PASSWORD and
UPDATEADDR to the password you used in the last step and the location of the
folder on the web, respectively. If the repository for your WordPress install is
not the official WordPress repository (e.g., the automattic repository), then
change the value of TAGSURL to point to your repository.

At this point you should be able to run the script.

5) How do I run this script?
wpupdate.sh /path/to/WordPress/install/location/
The trailing slash at the end is important; don't forget it.

6) What license is this script released under?
This script, and all associated files, are released under a Creative Commons
BY-NC-SA 3.0 US license.

7) I would like to thank you for the script. Do you take donations?
Yes. Yes I do. I take Dwolla or Paypal donations sent to donate@mischivous.com
